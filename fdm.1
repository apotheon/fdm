.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program fetches mail from a POP3 server or from 
.Em stdin
and delivers it based on a ruleset in the configuration file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffileXXX"
.It Fl a Ar account
Process only the specified account. This option may appear multiple times.
.Pp
.It Fl f Ar conffile
Specify the configuration file location. Default is
.Pa ~/fdm.conf .
.Pp
.It Fl l

.Xr syslog 3
rather than to
.Em stderr .
.Pp
.It Fl n
Do not process any accounts, just verify the configuration file syntax and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging. This option may be specified multiple times.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar account
Exclude the named account. Multiple
.Fl x
options may be specified.
.Pp
.It Ar fetch | poll

command polls the accounts in the configuration file and reports a message count for each.
.Pp
.El
.Sh LOCAL MAIL WITH SENDMAIL
.Nm
can be used to deliver local mail from 
.Xr sendmail 8
by making use of .forward files. An account fetching mail from 
.Em stdin
should be specified in the user's 
.Pa ~/.fdm.conf
file,
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
account "stdinacct" stdin
.Ed
.Pp
and the user's 
.Pa ~/.forward
file should be set to contain something like (including "s):
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
"|/usr/local/bin/fdm -l -a stdinacct fetch"
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr sendmail 8
will then invoke
.Nm
to deliver mail and 
.Nm
will pass it through any filtering rules as normal.
