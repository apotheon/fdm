- SMTP SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- look into GSSAPI, POP3's MD5 thing, all that other crap
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- fetch from mbox
- finish regression tests
	rules
	% tokens
	maildir
- message-id cache, to weed out message duplicates and allow keep for offline
  backups with imap without refetching: to-cache and in-cache actions.
- balance man pages/manual
- match attachment expressions:
	match attachment (index > 1 and size < 200 and type "fnmatch")
- attach get name from content-disposition
- ifdef/endif directives in config file, change -D to not require a value
- loops? how? is this even worth it?
- get only read/unread mail (IMAP only, probably) (read-only, unread-only) flags
  to account line
- handle multiple header instances when looking for users (other places?)
- fnmatch in find_header (don't forget ':')
- add some of the other non-useless stuff reformail can do, if any
- write/append/pipe would benefit from add-from per stdout
- deliver to IMAP folder
- refactor & clean up privsep mail transfer code
- -q option to silence normal (info) output
-- split fetch into next and get(line) and alloc mail outside
-- rework IO_NOWAIT
-- tidy child.c
-- audit for uses of special "off" variables where m->size would do
- is there any reason struct mail shouldn't point to a struct account?
- coalesce multiple IMAP deletions into a single call? is this possible?
- queue length options
- document mail_file, mbox_file and exec action
- document netrc
