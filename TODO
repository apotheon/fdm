- SMTP SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- finish regression tests
	rules
	% tokens
	maildir
- balance man pages/manual
- match attachment expressions:
	match attachment (index > 1 and size < 200 and type "fnmatch")
- attach get name from content-disposition
- more attachment stuff: remove-attachment, write-/pipe-attachment etc
- deliver to IMAP folder
- refactor & clean up privsep mail transfer code
- is there any reason struct mail shouldn't point to a struct account?
- cumulative effect of a compound action sucks
- better website
- generic flags on account so that no-verify/no-apop don't have to be in the
  right order
- fetch from compressed mbox: have to change fetch-mbox to not use mmap
- pop3 over pipe
- pop3/imap tests via pipe and coprocess
- all timeouts should be in seconds or milliseconds, decide which and make it so
- use TOP to grab only header and return to get body only if actually necessary
- automatically delete old mail on server once it reaches a certain age...
  does this break the barrier of what fdm is designed for?
- does imap need a to-fetch list a la pop3? having mails marked read that have
  not been successfully delivered is still a problem though. how can this be
  fixed?
- match string == and != instead of to would be nicer syntax
- document mbox fetch
- document all/account changes
- document new-only/old-only for POP3 and IMAP
- document new match string syntaxs (==, !=, ~=)
