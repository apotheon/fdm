- SMTP SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- finish regression tests
	rules
	% tokens
	maildir
- balance man pages/manual
- match attachment expressions:
	match attachment (index > 1 and size < 200 and type "fnmatch")
- attach get name from content-disposition
- more attachment stuff: remove-attachment, write-/pipe-attachment etc
- deliver to IMAP folder
- refactor & clean up privsep mail transfer code
- is there any reason struct mail shouldn't point to a struct account?
- cumulative effect of a compound action sucks
- better website
- generic flags on account so that no-verify/no-apop don't have to be in the
  right order
- fetch from compressed mbox: have to change fetch-mbox to not use mmap
- pop3 over pipe
- pop3/imap tests via pipe and coprocess
- all timeouts should be in seconds or milliseconds, decide which and make it so
- use TOP to grab only header and return to get body only if actually necessary
- automatically delete old mail on server once it reaches a certain age...
  does this break the barrier of what fdm is designed for?
- imap new/old is a bit backwards, better to create a list of mail-to-fetch and
  only look at those, rather than creating a list of mail-to-ignore and checking
  every mail. this probably means some tweaking to the way expunge+keep works
- it is only necessary to purge if mail has actually been deleted
- document mbox fetch
- document all/account changes
- document new-only/old-only for POP3 and IMAP
