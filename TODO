- SMTP SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- look into GSSAPI, POP3's MD5 thing, all that other crap
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- fetch from mbox
- finish regression tests
	rules
	% tokens
	maildir
- balance man pages/manual
- match attachment expressions:
	match attachment (index > 1 and size < 200 and type "fnmatch")
- attach get name from content-disposition
- get only read/unread mail (IMAP only, probably) (read-only, unread-only)
  flags to account line
- handle multiple header instances when looking for users (other places?)
- fnmatch in find_header (don't forget ':') -- new: match_header
- add some of the other non-useless stuff reformail can do, if any
- write/append/pipe would benefit from add-from per stdout
- deliver to IMAP folder
- refactor & clean up privsep mail transfer code
- is there any reason struct mail shouldn't point to a struct account?
- cumulative effect of a compound action sucks
- fetch smallest/largest mails first. best pattern? probably 1 small, then in
  decreasing size order, but with longer queue necessary
- there are way too many constant returns values and other weirdness. make it
  consistent in some way (closed=1, success=0, error=-1)
- weed is not doing its jobs, check domains
- better website
- get rid of printpath... (vopen/vmkdir? asprintf wrapper?)
- audit uses of MAXPATHLEN
- get rid of NOGRP/NOUSR
