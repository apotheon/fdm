- SMTP SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- look into GSSAPI, POP3's MD5 thing, all that other crap
- filter based on attachment size, quantity, type?
- daemon mode
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- add more examples to the man page
- audit man pages for clarity
- document nested rules
- think about whether or not we like MATCH_* (remember
  error can't be -1 for some reason... why?)
- clear up XXXs
- fetch from maildir/mbox, filter by date/age (age > 3 months, age invalid, etc), and add keep options, so i can use fdm to do my monthly mail prune rather than archivemail
