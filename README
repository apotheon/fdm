fdm is a program designed to fetch mail from POP3 or IMAP servers, or receive
local mail from stdin, and deliver it in various ways.

As of fdm 0.9, the caching has been changed, so Berkeley DB is no longer
required.

As of fdm 1.4, TDB is a required dependency.

See the included MANUAL file and the fdm(1) and fdm.conf(5) man pages for
installation and usage instructions. They are online at:

	http://fdm.sf.net

Some example configurations are included in the examples directory.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.

A mailing list is available for fdm users, see:

	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fdm-users
