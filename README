fdm is a small program designed to fetch mail from POP3 servers, or receive
local mail from stdin, and deliver it in various ways.

There are two main ways of using fdm, single-user and multi-user:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGLE-USER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When fdm is run as a non-root user, it will not attempt to drop privileges and
all mail will be delivered as the user it is run as - the "user" keyword on
rules and actions will be ignored. It is best run from cron every so often, for
example:

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l -x stdin fetch

Local mail can be delivered via stdin. See the fdm(1) man page for an example
using sendmail, users of other MTAs are on their own for the moment. Man page 
diffs and/or instructions I can format into the man page would be appreciated.

The included fdm.conf is an example of a single-user configuration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MULTI-USER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When fdm is run as a root user, it will drop to user _fdm and chroot to that
user's home directory in order to fetch mail. Mail will be delivered either
using the user specified in the rule or action or the user specified by the
"defuser" keyword. A config file for multiuser may look something like:

	set defuser "bob"
	account ......
	action "default" maildir "%h/mail/inbox"
	match "^(To:|Cc:).*jim@my.domain" user "jim" action "default"
	match "^(To:|Cc:).*sam@my.domain" user "sam" action "default"
	match all action "default" # the rest will use the default user

Alternatively, it could be something like this:

	set defuser "bob" # this is required but not used in this file
	account ......
	action "jim" user "jim" mbox "/var/mail/jim"
	action "sam" user "sam" mbox "/var/mail/sam"
	action "bob" user "bob" mbox "/var/mail/bob"
	match "^(To:|Cc:).*jim@my.domain" action "jim"
	match "^(To:|Cc:).*sam@my.domain" action "sam"
	match all action "bob"
	
Again, it is best to run fdm from cron.

This is beta-quality software. There will be bugs. I use maildirs so they are
the most tested.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.

I usually prefer to use the address below but with their customary efficiency
SF.net seem to be only permitting some mail to actually get through (or they
changed something and didn't tell us), so I can also be reached at:
