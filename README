fdm ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

fdm is a small program designed to fetch mail from POP3 or IMAP servers, or
receive local mail from stdin, and deliver it in various ways.

Installation -------------------------------------------------------------------

To build fdm, extract the source tarball and run the make(1) program:

    $ tar xzf fdm-0.6.tar.gz
    $ cd fdm-0.6
    $ make

Then run 'make install' to copy the newly-built files to the default locations
under /usr/local. The PREFIX environment variable may be set to specify an
alternative installation location.

    $ export PREFIX=/opt/		# defaults to /usr/local
    $ sudo make install
    $ man fdm
    $ fdm

Single-user --------------------------------------------------------------------

When fdm is run as a non-root user, it will not attempt to drop privileges and
all mail will be delivered as the user it is run as - the "user" keyword on
rules and actions will be ignored. It is best run from cron(8) every so often.
For example:

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l -x stdin fetch

Local mail can be delivered via stdin. See the fdm(1) man page for an example
using sendmail, users of other MTAs are on their own for the moment. Man page
diffs and/or instructions I can format into the man page would be appreciated.

The included fdm.conf(5) is an example of a single-user configuration. Other
examples may be found in the examples directory.

Multi-user ---------------------------------------------------------------------

When fdm is run as a root user, it will attempt to drop to user _fdm in order
to fetch mail. This user account must be present on the system or fdm will
fail. On OpenBSD, it may be added with:

	# useradd -u 999 -s /bin/nologin -d /var/empty -g=uid _fdm

A different user will be used to deliver mail. This user is the first 
available from the following list:

- a user specified in the rule or action definition in the configuration file,
  or extracted from the mail headers (controlled by the "from-headers" keyword),
- the user specified by the -u switch on the command line,
- the user specified by the "default-user" option.

A multi-user configuration may look something like:

	set default-user "bob"
	set headers { "to" "cc" "x-custom" }
	set domains { "my.domain" "localhost" }
	account ......
	action "default" user from-headers maildir "%h/mail/inbox"
	match all action "default"

Alternatively, it could be more limited, perhaps something like this:

	set default-user "bob" # this is required but not used in this file
	account ......
	action "jim" user "jim" mbox "/var/mail/jim"
	action "sam" user "sam" mbox "/var/mail/sam"
	action "bob" user "bob" mbox "/var/mail/bob"
	match "^(To:|Cc:).* jim@my.domain" action "jim" continue
	match "^(To:|Cc:).* sam@my.domain" action "sam" continue
	match "^(To:|Cc:).* bob@my.domain" action "bob" continue
	match unmatched action "bob" # all other mail will end up with bob

If POP3 accounts are used, fdm is best run from cron, but it can also be set up
to deliver mail via stdin from an MTA. Configuring this is left as an exercise
for the reader ;-). If using some MTA that can invoke fdm with the -u option, 
something like this would probably work:

	account stdin "stdin"
	action "default" mbox "/var/mail/%u"
	match all action "default"

Since fdm will then deliver using the default user from stdin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at the fdm(1) and fdm.conf(5) man pages for details of syntax, etc.

This is beta-quality software. There will be bugs. I use it single-user with
maildirs so this is the most tested.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.

I'm keen to add more example configs, so if yours is more than a few lines
and you don't mind it being included in the fdm distribution, strip out any
usernames/passwords and send it to me. I'd particularly like to have any that
use features not used in the current examples, but simpler configs are also
welcome.

I usually prefer to use the address below but if for some reason it doesn't
work, I can also be reached at: nicm123@gmail.com
