fdm is a small program designed to fetch mail from POP3 or IMAP servers, or
receive local mail from stdin, and deliver it in various ways.

NOTE: As of fdm 0.8, Linux users need to have a Berkely DB implementation
installed that is compatible with the one in the various *BSD libc (v1.85).

On Debian, the "libdb4.3" and "libdb4.3-dev" packages seem to work. I had a
few problems with later versions (they built but then caused segfaults)
because they seemed to interfere with something else, possibly because I
was linking with them incorrectly or possibly because the packages are broken.

Slackware's db44 package works fine.

Other Linux distributions should have similar packages, or the source is
available from:

http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html

Comments, instructions, package names etc for other distributions to include
here are welcome.

See the included MANUAL file and the fdm(1) and fdm.conf(5) man pages for
installation and usage instructions. They are online at:

	http://fdm.sf.net

Some example configurations are included in the examples directory.

This is beta software. There will be bugs.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.

I'm keen to add more example configs, so if yours is more than a few lines
and you don't mind it being included in the fdm distribution, strip out any
usernames/passwords and send it to me. I'd particularly like to have any that
use features not used in the current examples, but simpler configs are also
welcome.

I usually prefer to use the address below but if for some reason it doesn't
work, I can also be reached at: nicm123@gmail.com
