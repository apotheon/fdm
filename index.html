FDM(1)                     OpenBSD Reference Manual                     FDM(1)

<B>NAME</B>
     <B>fdm </B>- fetch and deliver mail

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>fdm </B>[<B>-lnv</B>] [<B>-f </B><I>conffile</I>] [<B>-u </B><I>user</I>] [<B>-a </B><I>account</I>] [<B>-x </B><I>account</I>] [<I>fetch </I>|
         <I>poll</I>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>fdm </B>program fetches mail from a POP3 server or from <I>stdin </I>and deliv-
     ers it based on a ruleset in the configuration file.

     The options are as follows:

     <B>-a </B><I>account      </I>Process only the specified account. This option may ap-
                     pear multiple times.

     <B>-f </B><I>conffile     </I>Specify the configuration file location. Default is
                     <I>~/fdm.conf</I>.

     <B>-l              </B>Log using syslog(3) rather than to <I>stderr</I>.

     <B>-n              </B>Do not process any accounts, just verify the configura-
                     tion file syntax and exit.

     <B>-u </B><I>user         </I>Specify the default user for delivery. This overrides the
                     <B>defuser </B>option in the configuration file.

     <B>-v              </B>Request verbose logging. This option may be specified
                     multiple times.

     <B>-x </B><I>account      </I>Exclude the named account. Multiple <B>-x </B>options may be
                     specified.

     <I>fetch </I>| <I>poll    </I>The <I>fetch </I>command instructs <B>fdm </B>to fetch and deliver mes-
                     sages. The <I>poll </I>command polls the accounts in the config-
                     uration file and reports a message count for each.

<B>LOCAL MAIL WITH SENDMAIL</B>
     <B>fdm </B>can be used to deliver local mail from sendmail(8) by making use of
     .forward files. An account fetching mail from <I>stdin </I>should be specified
     in the user's <I>~/.fdm.conf </I>file,

           account "stdinacct" stdin

     and the user's <I>~/.forward </I>file should be set to contain something like
     (including quotations marks):

           "|/usr/local/bin/fdm -l -a stdinacct fetch"

     sendmail(8) will then invoke <B>fdm </B>to deliver mail and <B>fdm </B>will pass it
     through any filtering rules as normal.

FDM.CONF(5)               OpenBSD Programmer's Manual              FDM.CONF(5)

<B>NAME</B>
     <B>fdm.conf </B>- fdm configuration file

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     This manual page describes the fdm(1) configuration file. It defines
     <I>accounts </I>from which to fetch mail, a number of possible <I>actions </I>to take,
     and <I>rules </I>connecting a regexp with an action. The file is parsed once
     from top to bottom, so action and account definitions must appear before
     they are referenced in a rule. Rules are evaluated from first to last and
     (unless overridden by the <B>continue </B>keyword) evaluation stops at the first
     match.

     The file has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.

     Regexps and strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Special characters
     in regexps and strings must be escaped. Note that this may mean double-
     escaping in regexps.

     Possible commands are covered in the following sections.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     Options are configured using the <B>set </B>command.  It may be followed by the
     following options, one per command:

     <B>maxsize </B><I>size</I>
             This is used to set the maximum size of a mail. Mails larger than
             this limit are dropped and, if applicable, not deleted from the
             server.

             The size may be specified as a plain number in bytes or with a
             suffix of `K' for kilobytes, `M' for megabytes or `G' for giga-
             bytes. The default is one gigabyte.

     <B>deltoobig</B>
             If this option is specified, fdm(1) attempts to delete messages
             which exceed <B>maxsize</B>, and continue. If it is not specified, over-
             size messages are a fatal error and cause fdm(1) to abort.

     <B>defuser </B><I>user</I>
             This sets the default user to change to before delivering mail,
             if fdm(1) is running as root and no alternative user is specified
             as part of the action or rule. This option may be override with
             the <B>-u </B>switch on the command line. A default user must be given
             if running as root.

     <B>locktypes </B><I>locktype ...</I>
             This specifies the locks to be used for mbox locking. Possible
             types are <I>fcntl</I>, <I>flock</I>, and <I>dotlock</I>.  The <I>flock </I>and <I>fcntl </I>types
             are mutually exclusive. The default is <I>flock</I>.

<B>ACCOUNTS</B>
     The <B>account </B>command is used to instruct fdm(1) to fetch mail from an ac-
     count. The syntax is:

     <B>account </B><I>name type </I>[<I>args</I>]

     The <I>name </I>argument is a string specifying a name for the account. Support-
     ed account types and arguments are:

     <B>stdin   </B>This account type reads mail from <I>stdin</I>, if it is connected to a
             pipe. This may be used to deliver mail from sendmail(8), see
             fdm(1) for details.

     <B>pop3 server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass</I>

     <B>pop3s server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass</I>
             These statements define a POP3 or POP3S account. The <I>host</I>, <I>user</I>
             and <I>pass </I>arguments must be strings. The port option may be either
             a string which will be looked up in the services(5) database, or
             a number. If it is omitted, the default port (143 for POP3, 993
             for POP3S) is used.

<B>ACTIONS</B>
     The <B>action </B>command is used to define actions. These may be specified by
     name in rules (see below) to perform some action on a mail. The syntax
     is:

     <B>action </B><I>name </I>[<B>user </B><I>user</I>] <I>action</I>

     The <I>name </I>is a string defining a name for the action. The <I>user </I>keyword
     specifies a user to which fdm(1) should change before executing the ac-
     tion. The action's user may be overridden in the matching rule. This key-
     word has no effect if fdm is run as non-root.

     The possible values for <I>action </I>are listed below. In actions for which a
     <I>command </I>or <I>path </I>is specified, the following substitutions are made before
     it is used: <I>%a </I>is replaced by the account name, <I>%h </I>by the current user's
     home directory, <I>%t </I>by the name of the current action, <I>%u </I>by the current
     user's login name and <I>%n </I>by the UID.

     <B>drop    </B>Discard the mail.

     <B>maildir </B><I>path</I>
             Save the mail to the maildir specified by <I>path</I>.

     <B>mbox </B><I>path</I>
             Append the mail to the mbox at <I>path</I>.

     <B>pipe </B><I>command</I>
             Pipe the entire mail to <I>command</I>.

     <B>write </B><I>path</I>
             Write the mail to <I>path</I>.

     <B>append </B><I>path</I>
             Append the mail to <I>path</I>.

     <B>smtp server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] [<B>to </B><I>to</I>]
             Connect to an SMTP server and attempt to deliver the mail to it.
             If <I>to </I>is specified, it is passed to the server in the RCPT TO
             command. If not, the current user and host names are used.

<B>RULES</B>
     Rules are specified using the <B>match </B>keyword. It has the following basic
     form:

     <B>match </B><I>regexps </I>[<I>accounts</I>] [<B>user </B><I>user</I>] <I>actions </I>[<B>continue</B>]

     The <I>regexps </I>part has the following syntax:

     [<B>case</B>] <I>regexp </I>[<B>in headers </B>| <B>in body</B>] [<B>and </B>| <B>or </B><I>...</I>]

     It specifies a list of regexps against which each mail should be matched.
     The regexp matches may be restricted to either the headers or body of the
     message by specifying either <B>in headers </B>or <B>in body</B>.  The <B>case </B>keyword
     forces the regexp to be matched case-sensitively: the default is case-in-
     sensitive matching. Multiple regexps may be specified by chaining them
     with <B>and </B>or <B>or </B>keywords. The regexps are matched from left to right.

     The optional <B>user </B>keyword instructs fdm(1) to change to the specified us-
     er before performing any of the actions for this rule, if running as
     root.

     Both the <I>accounts </I>and <I>actions </I>parts consist either of a single name or a
     list of names enclosed in braces:

     <B>account </B><I>name </I>| <B>accounts </B>{ <I>name ... </I>}

     <B>action </B><I>name </I>| <B>actions </B>{ <I>name ... </I>}

     The <I>accounts </I>list is used to limit rules to matching mail within a set of
     accounts, and the <I>actions </I>list specifies the actions to perform when the
     rule matches a mail. The actions are performed from left to right in the
     order they are specified in the rule definition.

     If the <B>continue </B>keyword is present, evaluation will not stop if this rule
     is matched. Instead, fdm(1) will continue to match further rules after
     performing any actions for this rule.
