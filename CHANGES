31 May 2009

* Print a warning on missing maildirs when fetching from them rather than
  crashing or giving an error. Reported by Frank Terbeck.

17 May 2009

* Introduce a configure script and tidy up build infrastructure.

02 May 2009

* GMail IMAP doesn't correctly set the \Seen flag after UID FETCH BODY[], so
  explicitly set it with STORE when mail is kept. Reported by Patrice Clement.

30 April 2009

* Properly count mails when polling multiple folders on a single IMAP server,
  reported by Claudio M. Alessi.

24 March 2009

* Support user and pass on NNTP, requested by Michael Hamann.

08 March 2009

* Escape . properly when delivering to SMTP.

27 December 2008

* Don't be as strict about format at the end of messages when using IMAP -
  accept additional information as well as FLAGS. Reported by rivo nurges.

22 December 2008

* fdm 1.6 released.

17 December 2008

* Only look at HOME environment variable if -h flag is passed.

28 October 2008

* Alter IMAP fetching code to build a UID list of mails to fetch and then fetch
  them, rather than iterating through all the mails regardless.

07 September 2008

* Process all privsep messages in parent rather than just the first.
  Fixes timeouts reported by Frank Terbeck.

08 August 2008

* Sort fetch list for POP3 to preserve server mailbox order, requested
  by Jeremy C Reed.
* Fix bug where current user could overwrite default-user/command-user
  from configuration file.

26 June 2008

* Lookup using courier-authlib. Build with make -DLOOKUP_COURIER and
  use "set lookup-order courier passwd".
* Framework for changing user lookup method. At the moment only normal
  Unix passwd (getpwnam(3)) is supported. This means only string
  usernames are supported - to enter a numeric Unix UID, enclose it
  in quotes.
* Get rid of from-headers which was ugly and unreliable.

30 May 2008

* Make NNTP fetching save the cache file after each mail since some NNTP
  servers (such as my ISP's) are horrendously unreliable.
* Handle 423/430 response from ARTICLE command in NNTP correctly.

26 May 2008

* New option: parallel-accounts. Sets number of accounts to fetch in parallel.

22 May 2008

* deliver-imap fetch method; suggested by Jason Dixon a while ago.

03 April 2008

* Support an extra space on the optional FLAGS response when fetching a mail,
  fixes problems with CommuniGate Pro, thanks to Anthony Wood.
* New flags, no-cram-md5 and no-login, on IMAP accounts to force fdm not to
  use cram-md5 or login authentication even if the server supports it. From
  Anthony Wood.

01 April 2008

* Support SIGUSR1 as an alias for SIGINFO, for platforms without SIGINFO.

06 March 2008

* Support multiple folders (folders { "a" "b" }) on IMAP fetching. Requested by
  Claudio Alessi.

05 March 2008

* Print current progress on SIGINFO. Be careful with this, it is possible
  there are places where an unhandled EINTR would cause fdm to die.

04 March 2008

* fdm 1.5 released.

10 February 2008

* Consistently use geteuid().
* Correct mail_month/mail_dayofyear tags.

10 January 2008

* Added "from" to smtp action to specify envelope from. Requested by Marco
  Lopes.

07 January 2008

* Use <>s around envelope addresses when using SMTP. Reported by Marco Lopes.

08 December 2007

* Don't let mbox or maildir fetch code exit and free stuff until all the mail is
  dealt with (queues are empty). Fixes mbox fetching problems reported by
  akarinotengoku at gmail.com.

03 December 2007

* Bug fix: restore non-blocking mode properly after constructing SSL
  connection. This bug prevented SSL over a proxy working.

06 November 2007

* Use +FLAGS.SILENT instead of +FLAGS to mark IMAP mail as deleted, as we
  don't need the new flags.

03 November 2007

* Exchange sometimes includes a FLAGS update as part of its FETCH response,
  which made fdm complain. Change to accept it without error. Reported by
  Leo D'Angelo.
* Google IMAP has problems with naked flag lists on STORE commands (which are
  valid). Change to enclose the flags list in brackets. Reported by Andrew
  Pantyukhin.

25 October 2007

* New option, no-create, prevents fdm creating missing path components or files
  when delivering to maildirs or mboxes.
* Create entire paths if missing when delivering to maildirs or mboxes.

10 October 2007

* Don't accept "+OK N" as well as "+OK N M" in response to STAT.
* New option: command-user. This is the user used to run exec/pipe match
  conditions if one is not specified. The default is the user who ran fdm
  (root if running as root).

09 October 2007

* Command line cache manipulation. The following commands are available:

	fdm cache list [path]
		List details of cache path or all caches in the configuration
		file if not specified.

	fdm cache dump path
		Dump cache keys in the form "key time" where time is is
		Unix time (seconds from epoch). This allows to easily sort by
		time:
		
			fdm cache dump ~/my/cache|sort -n +2

		Or to print the time in a particular date format:
	
			fdm cache dump ~/my/cache|while read i; do
				set -- $i
				echo $1 `date -r$2 "+%Y-%m-%d% %H:%M:%S"`
			done

		And so on.

	fdm cache add path key
	fdm cache remove path key
		Add a key to or remove a key from a cache.

	fdm cache clear path
		Clear an entire cache (remove all the keys).

	This feature suggested by Thomas@BIC.
* Restore regress files to distribution. Requested by Mike Erdely for the
  OpenBSD port. Note that there is no guarantee regressions tests will run on
  other operating systems!

02 October 2007

* "remove-from-cache" action.
* Rename to-cache to add-to-cache (to-cache remains as a compatibility alias).
  This is to match the planned remove-from-cache and perhaps other similar.
* The account/all deprecated support and warnings are now gone.

01 October 2007

* fdm 1.4 released.

25 September 2007

* For POP3 and IMAP, don't have a separate state for waiting-to-purge. Mail
  could potentially be dropped (in fact, was very likely to be) while waiting
  for queues to empty in that state. Instead, loop though the next state which
  ensures all dropped mail is dealt with before attempting to purge.
* When tags are replaced in strings, shell metacharacters are now stripped.
  This is to permit expressions such as:

	match "^Subject: (.*)" action tag "subject" value "%1"
	match all ... action exec "echo %[subject]"

  Without risk of the subject being, for instance, ";rm -Rf ~". This applies
  to all tags, even those defined manually or by fdm itself, and happens every
  time any tag is inserted (so in the above, the subject is in fact stripped
  twice, once when inserted as %1 and once as %[subject] - the second time to
  no effect).

  The list of characters to strip can be altered using the strip-characters
  option. The default is:

	set strip-characters "\\<>$%^&*|{}[]\"'`;"

  Stripping may be completely disabled by setting this string to "" (this will
  return to the old behaviour), or disabled per-tag by prefixing the tag name
  with :, for example %[:subject] or %:1.

  Note that this protection is limited: it does not, for instance, prevent use
  of ".." if using tags to create paths. Care should always be taken when
  inserting any data extracted from an incoming mail into a shell command.

24 September 2007

* All regexps (match, string, command) are now case insensitive by default and 
  may be prefixed by "case" to enable case sensitivity.
* The match string syntax changes were bloat and are reverted.

19 September 2007

* POP3 over pipe. Same as IMAP.

18 September 2007

* Split POP3 core off into pop3-common.c a la IMAP, in preparation for
  POP3-over-pipe.
* Change POP3 old/new mail to work from a list of mail-to-fetch and only ask
  for that mail, rather than retrieving and checking every mail UID.

17 September 2007

* Quote IMAP folder name to allow spaces and so on. SF bug 1791056.

05 September 2007

* Don't purge if no mails have been dropped.

03 September 2007

* Options to fetch only new or old mail from POP3 or IMAP accounts. Based on
  request to mailing list, and ensuing discussion, from patnel972-fdm at 
  yahoo.fr.

  This introduces two new keywords for accounts: new-only and old-only. For
  POP3 accounts, a cache file must also be specified (similar to NNTP); this
  holds the list of UIDs for all the mail present in the account on the last
  fetch. For IMAP, the server-managed \Seen flag is used. Servers should set
  this flag once a mail has been read (downloaded). The \Recent flag isn't 
  used because it is unset when any client is told about the mail - even a 
  poll is enough.

  Examples of syntax are:

	account pop3 server ... new-only cache "~/my/pop3.cache.file"

	account imap server ... old-only
 
  This is useful for people who like to keep mail on the server to be read
  using a web interface or suchlike. Note that it is up to the user to make
  sure their account doesn't get full! fdm does not check this or have any
  abilities to delete or manage mail that isn't fetched.

02 September 2007

* More changes to io.c/command.c to fix issues on Linux introduced by fixes to
  IMAP-over-pipe. Hopefully all working now.

31 August 2007

* Rewrote user header searching and address matching to clean up the code and
  work with multiple headers, also fix some fnmatch problems.

30 August 2007

* Fixed silly bug in replace.c. Using the base rather than data offset for %0-%9
  so they pointed at the wrong data if a from line had been trimmed. Found by
  Jo Fahlke, reported via Frank Terbeck through a Debian bug report.
* Move command-line macro parsing into parse.y/parse-fn.c and make it actually
  work again. Found by Jo Fahlke, reported via Frank Terbeck.
* account and all tokens are now normal match conditions. So, you can do useless
  stuff like:

	match all and all or all ...

  AND, more importantly, matching accounts now CHANGES to require an operator
  and follow the normal left-to-right precedence. So:

	match all account "a*" ...

  Becomes:

	match account "a*" ...

  And:

	match "a regexp" or age > 10 accounts { "acc1" acc2" } ...

  Becomes:

	match accounts { "acc1" "acc2 " } and "a regexp" or age > 10 ...

  fdm 1.4 will emit a warning and convert the old style into the new style, but
  in 1.5 the warning will become an error, and in 1.6 the old code will be
  removed entirely. So update your rulesets!

  Note that due to limitations in yacc, the line number of the rule in the
  warning may be off by a few lines (usually one line too far).

25 August 2007

* Break timer stuff off into timer.c.
* Fix queue-high == 1 to not hang after first mail.

24 August 2007

* Don't even try to check for command child exit until its std{in,out,err} are
  closed. Hopefully fixes problems seen on Linux by Frank Terbeck.
* Be more consistent about lists when parsing configuration file.
* Don't try to strip duplicates from any lists instead of trying for some of
  them and not others.
* remove-header now accepts a list of headers in {}.

23 August 2007

* Yet another fetch reorganisation to try to make it clearer. Move tracking
  completed mail into fetch code, move mail and state stuff outside, and
  simplify the API and data structures. Also change the way the fetch poll loop
  works and fix some potential problems with IMAP-over-pipe. Hopefully few
  regressions... This loses the IMAP multiple delete combining but that isn't
  a huge loss.

18 August 2007

* Tidy up io code a little, break some big functions and split headers stuff
  into dedicated io.h. Also lift fd limit.
* Make SMTP delivery work again (blank lines were failing a length check in
  buffer_add from io_write). SF bug 1776786.

16 August 2007

* Remove header action now allows fnmatch patterns.
* Fix a silly bug with removing headers.
* Clarify headers/body again. The body offset is now the first byte of the
  body, so a mail of a single blank line has size == body == 1 (so, body
  size == 0 rather than 1). "\nBody" always had body == 1 and not having
  "\n" the same was confusing me.

15 August 2007

* A few POP3 servers supply an APOP cookie and then refuse the APOP command.
  Handle them with a "no-apop" flag to POP3 account statements to disable
  APOP. Reported by Frank Terbeck.

10 August 2007

* Combine append into write and exec into pipe even more to get rid of
  deliver-append.c and deliver-exec.c.
* add-from on stdout delivery is gone, an acceptable from line can be prepended
  using rewrite.

06 August 2007

* TDB is now a mandatory dependency.

03 August 2007

* Fetching from mboxes.

02 August 2007

* Handle IMAP mails properly if they have no trailing newline.
* Use APOP for POP3 or CRAM-MD5 for IMAP if offered by server. Note that fdm
  currently does NOT fall back to plaintext auth if the server offers APOP
  or CRAM-MD5 but it doesn't work.

01 August 2007

* fdm 1.3c released.
* Wrong size for match buffer in pcre.c. SF.net bug 1765524.
* Try to buffer as much as possible when reading, this prevents problems since
  SSL_read seems to buffer data itself which poll can't know about.
* Fix a bug with SSL where a "don't stop" error (want read/want write) would
  make fdm think there was data received when there wasn't, resulting in
  spurious new lines and fetching being aborted. This somehow failed to show
  up in the two months since 1.1 was released. Reported by Steven Mestdagh.

31 July 2007

* Accept only ".\r\n" as terminator for POP3 and NNTP, not a '.' followed by
  anything except '.'.
* Don't include a leading space in the POP3 UID.

30 July 2007

* fdm 1.3a and 1.3b released.
* Change to using setitimer for SSL_connect timeout. OpenBSD, and possibly
  others, limit SO_RCVTIMEO to 327 seconds. Also try smaller timeouts if setting
  the first one fails, to a minimum of 30 seconds. Reported by Steven Mestdagh.
* fdm 1.3 released.

25 July 2007

* Tidied and refactored much of file.c and deliver-{mbox,maildir}.c.
* Brought back fatal and fatalx as #defines which prepend __func__ and pass
  through to log_fatal/log_fatalx.

24 July 2007

* Embedding an undefined macro in a string with ${} is no longer an error, it
  is just treated as empty. This makes ifdef/endif more useful.

17 July 2007

* Only store shared filename (NAME_MAX) in struct shm and construct path into
  temp dir on-the-fly. Saves (PATH_MAX - NAME_MAX) per struct.
* Trailing newlines are now stripped from message_id tag (as they used to
  be). This makes any existing caches by message-id useless.
* Use SO_RCVTIMEO to apply configured timeout when connecting to SSL servers
  (SSL_connect must block as it is the easiest way to ensure the certificate is
  received before checking its validity).

16 July 2007

* Outright reject configuration files that use caches unless built with -DDB,
  rather than waiting until the cache is used.
* Rewrite the malloc debugging stuff: lose the call counting, use a splay
  tree instead of a fixed array and use __builtin_return_address and direct
  calls from xmalloc.c rather than horrible #define games, even if it means 
  the ultimate output is less useful.

15 July 2007

* Permit each account to start multiple delivery child processes simultaneously
  (up to the maximum queue length). This doesn't help much in normal cases but
  with particularly lengthy but non-CPU-intensive delivery actions (try exec
  "sleep 1" ;-P), it can help a lot.
* Introduce some randomness into the lock sleep delay when waiting for mboxes.

14 July 2007

* Use mremap(2) on Linux.
 
13 July 2007

* Fix stupid bug (grr) in strb.c which caused a segfault if realloc moved the
  buffer when it was being expanded; also clean up macros a bit when here.

11 July 2007

* Add %[mail_rfc822date] which contains the mail date and time (or current date
  and time if invalid) in RFC822 format and %[rfc822date] which is the same for
  the current date/time. I probably need to stop adding tags now $() works.
* Additional example from Giorgio Lando (examples/g-lando.conf).
* Add two-digit year (year2/mail_year2) and hostname tags.
* Simplify fetching: line counting and body detection is now done globally for
  all fetch types in the mail queuing code, as is checking for empty and 
  oversize mails.
* There is now no concept of a body-less mail (m->body == -1). Mails with
  no separating blank line are assumed to be entirely body (m->body == 0),
  otherwise the body is the first byte after the separator.
* Fix a long-standing bug in openlock (mail.c): if open(2) failed, the lock
  file was not removed.
* NNTPS fetching, suggested by Maximilian Gass.
* After rethinking, remove some useless fclose error checks.

08 July 2007

* Check permissions on include files as well as main configuration file.
* First new parser bug: include files should be subject to tag replacement,
  noticed by Frank Terbeck.

05 July 2007

* Move to rewritten log.c which which makes the syslog/stderr hacks I had made
  to the old version less fugly.

02 July 2007

* If a mail has no body, insert new headers at the start instead of the end.
  This matches formail's behaviour. Requested by Giorgio Lando. Note there is
  no change to the regexp "in body" behaviour, although perhaps there should be.
* Sort out the localtime(3)/strftime(3) mess by actually reading the man page
  and time.h. This means July is now the seventh rather than sixth month. 
  Reported by Giorgio Lando.

29 June 2007

* Split parse helper functions out into parse-fn.c and do lots of other cleanup 
  of parse.y and lex.c.
* New lexer makes ifdef/ifndef/endif possible, although not completely elegant.
  Syntax is: ifdef $macro .... endif. Note that stuff inside ifdefs must still
  be valid syntax!
* Scrap use of lex in favour of custom C lexer. This allows (yet another)
  workaround for include files, to make stuff like this work:

	$host = $(hostname)
	include "file.${host}"

* Combine multiple IMAP deletions together into one command where possible,
  although I doubt it makes any actual difference.

28 June 2007

* Shell commands may now be called when parsing the ruleset using $() and %()
  operators:

	%year = %(date +%y)

	$arch = $(uname -m)
	
  These are executed at parse time. Sections between the brackets within "s
  are subject to escape and macro replacement as normal; parts outside
  quotes or inside 's are not. For example:

	$SHELL = "test"
	$cmd = $(echo "${SHELL} $SHELL \${SHELL}")

  Takes advantage of the fact that fdm requires {}s and the shell does not to
  yield:

	added macro "$cmd": "test /bin/ksh /bin/ksh"

  As with macros, commands may be used at any point a string or number is
  appropriate.
* The mail time tags (mail_year, mail_quarter, etc) now use underscores in their
  names rather than dashes, for consistency.
* Deliver append-string is no more, it is trivially replaced using rewrite.
* Built-in cache using TDB (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/). Currently
  disabled by default, enabled by building with make -DDB.

  Used as followed;

	# Declare the cache.
	$db = "~/.fdm.db"
	cache $db expire 2 weeks

	match not string "%[message_id]" to "" {
		# Filter messages already in the cache.	
		match in-cache $db key "%[message_id]" action
			mbox "duplicate-mail"

		# Add message-ids to the cache (any other string can be added
		# but message-ids are most useful).
		match all action
			to-cache $db key "%[message_id]" continue
	}

  Note the guard statement - the key can't be empty and news (NNTP) messages
  don't have a message-id.

27 June 2007

* New tags taken from the date header corresponding to the current time tags:
  mail_hour, mail_year, etc. If the header is invalid, the current time is used.
  Request/idea from Maximilian Gass.
* Make fdm-sanitize also obfuscate the lengths of login/pass with IMAP.
* Bug fix: "and not" rather than "not and" in ruleset -vv output.
* "match tag ..." is now completely gone.
* "value" keyword is now preferred for add-header action:

	action "ah" add-header "My-Header" value "ABC"

  but is not mandatory.
* fdm 1.2 released.

08 June 2007

* Check CN against FQDN and user-supplied host when verifying SSL certificates.

21 May 2007

* New layout for most of the fetch code. Now pretty much everything is done
  using a state machine for each fetch type rather than a mixture of linear
  code and state machine. Mail is now enqueued/dequeued using callbacks rather
  than returning status codes.

16 May 2007

* SHM_SYSV is no more.

10 May 2007

* Fix typo in manual and use DESTDIR in *akefile, from Frank Terbeck as a result
  of Debian package creation.

09 May 2007

* Code tidying in io.c and command.c.

08 May 2007

* Couple of fixes for stupid things in ARRAY_* macros, one of which was hiding
  a minor bug. Don't know what I was thinking when I wrote them.

04 May 2007

* "match tag ..." is now not supported.
* Permit actions to call other actions:

	action "one" ...
	action "two" ...
	action "three" {
		 ...
		actions { "one" "two" }
	}

  A maximum of five levels is permitted, spoiling the fun of:

	action "x" { action "x" }

30 April 2007

* Optionally verify SSL certificates. This can be turned on with the
  "verify-certificates" option and disabled per account by appending a
  "no-verify" flag to the definition.
* Option to use PCRE (build with make -DPCRE).

19 April 2007

* Count the number of messages properly when there is no done function (such as
  for NNTP).

10 April 2007

* Install into bin rather than sbin when using GNUmakefile. From Frank Terbeck.

06 April 2007

* fdm 1.1 released.

04 April 2007

* Set the socket non-blocking in before setting up SSL in connect.c, otherwise
  SSL_connect might block.

03 April 2007

* Instead of doing complicated things to see if a mmap'd region is okay, just
  fill it with zeros using write(2). This also avoids FS fragmentation on
  FreeBSD, per its mmap(2). Also use MAP_NOSYNC.

30 March 2007

* Allow plural and singular to be interchanged in most places, don't insist on
  "accounts { "abc" }" and "account "abc"".

29 March 2007

* Tags are now done using an action (tag) rather than a special-case match
  rule. The old way still works but generates a warning which will become an
  error within a few releases.
* Because yacc needs to move back and forwards, just swapping the file out from
  under it when including can cause problems. So, switch to letting lex do all
  the work and feed the include file to yacc as if it was inline. This sucks a
  bit but there aren't many other options. Reported by Frank Terbeck.
* Lambda actions:

	match "regexp" action mbox ...
	match "regexp" actions {
		rewrite ...
		mbox ...
	}

28 March 2007

* Compound actions, using a list in {}s, eg:

	action "abc" {
		rewrite ...
		mbox ...
	}

* Macros shouldn't be expanded inside single quotes. Fixed.
* + may be used to concatenate strings.
* Allow short-circuit evaluation of 'and' and 'or' operators.

27 March 2007

* Accept size with either CRLF or LF as when warning about bad size predictions
  from POP3 servers. Google gives the size with LF and then sends the mail data
  (as it must do) with CRLF.

26 March 2007

* Fix stupid use of struct strings for uid_ts and make users be printed when
  printing rules, actions, accounts.
* Option to use SYSV shared memory (build with make -DSHM_SYSV). Not a real
  option, or documented, yet because I'm not sure how to deal with cleaning up
  on SIGTERM. It might even go away again.
* Play some games to ensure that that the full extent of the mmap'd temporary
  file is actually writable before using it. Otherwise if there is insufficient
  disk space we risk getting an unexpected SIGBUS later when trying to use it.
* When sending delivery done messages, check that the child process isn't dead
  before trying to talk to it.

25 March 2007

* Handle unlink(2)/fclose(3) failures, led to discovery of a missing fflush
  before fsync and a double-unlink of a tmp file (bad!), also fixed. Part of bug
  1687830 from Markus Elfring. Also fix some closedir(3) return value checks.
  I'm still on the fence about close(2). SUSv3 says that it can only die on
  EBADF, EINTR and EIO: the first will cause problems before close, and I don't
  see how the latter can affect anything given that write(2) (or fsync(2) when
  applicable) will have previously returned success (fdm already checks their
  return). OTOH, it would be both tidy and future-proof to check it.

22 March 2007

* Return total number of mails from start function if possible and print
  "X of Y" when reporting mail fetches with -v.

21 March 2007

* queue-low and queue-high options. Default queue limit is 2.
* Default maximum-size now 32 MB and maximum now 1 GB.

20 March 2007

* -q option to quiet unnecessary chatter.
* If user/pass is not specified on IMAP or POP3 accounts, attempt to read it
  from the ~/.netrc file.
* Redo child fetch stuff so that exec/pipe matches actually works
* Stop exec/pipe matches early if only checking for regexp and it is found.
* Sprinkle a few fsyncs, and block SIGTERM while writing to mboxes.

18 March 2007

* Informational messages now go to stdout rather than stderr.

16 March 2007

* Change so that the child uses poll(2) on all the fds rather than letting
  the fetch-* stuff poll and periodically checking the parent fd.
* Make delivery children be handled in the main loop (fdm.c) along with
  the fetch children. This means that different accounts will not block each
  other when delivering. I tried allowing multiple simultaneous deliveries
  for each account but it doesn't work very well, particularly regarding
  errors.

15 March 2007

* Seriously reduce -v output in favour of -vv and -vvv.
* Save mail in a queue as it is fetched and perform matching/delivery on it
  while waiting for the server to send the next mail. This can give a 20-50%
  speed increase with some rulesets, particularly with slow POP3 servers.

13 March 2007

* Don't pass stdin to poll(3) instead of closed sockets. Fixes problems with
  rewrite and empty mails on Linux. Reported & tested by Frank Terbeck.

12 March 2007

* The timeout setting is now used for commands too.
* Expand leading ~s into home directories where appropriate.
* Section headings are now numbered in MANUAL.

11 March 2007

* You can't use a va_list twice even when it's passed in as an argument. Duh.
  Fixes segfaults on PPC. Reported by Daniel Wilmer.

08 March 2007

* Try to introduce some consistency into tag replacement in strings. Introduce
  a new type (struct replstr) which indicates a string that should be replaced
  before use, and try to make sure replacement happens possibly for all strings
  where replacement should happen on parse. Hopefully this will make it easier
  to handle replacement properly in future too.

07 March 2007

* Handle POLLHUP properly in io.c: if it is set and POLLIN isn't set, the
  fd has closed. This makes stdin delivery work properly on Linux 2.4.

06 March 2007

* Submatches with commands are now added as tags command0 to command9.
* pipe actions now use the command.c framework, which means their stderr is
  logged and stdout discarded.
* mail_file tag added by maildir delivery and mbox_file by mbox. Also pass the
  tags block up and down between parent and child so these tags actually stick.
* A new exec action, similar to pipe but stdin is /dev/null. This is useful
  in combination with the mail_file and mbox_file tags.

04 March 2007

* Bug fix: fill in the correct size for maildir fetched mail rather than using
  the rounded-up size and adding a ton of nulls.
* -D on the command line overrides macro definitions in the configuration file.
* Build the attachment list when the first attachment match rule is found rather
  than for every mail regardless.
* Add a message_id tag to each mail.

03 March 2007

* add-header action and lines, body_lines, header_lines tags for IMAP/POP3,
  suggested by Frank Terbeck.
* Linux dirname(3)/basename(3) screws up the buffer. Fixed it thanks to Frank
  Terbeck.
* Fixed bugs in string parsing thanks to Frank Terbeck.

02 March 2007

* Made add_tag use varargs and added a server_uid tag to POP3/IMAP messages.
* Added infrastructure to maintain a cache of variable-length strings within a
  single contiguous block of data (strb.c), so it can be passed easily up
  to the parent process. Use this for storing mail tags to get rid of the
  arbitrary tag length limits.

28 February 2007

* Man page cleanups, from Tamas TEVESZ.

27 February 2007

* fdm 1.0 released.

22 February 2007

* Fixed silly typo in NNTP code check. SF bug 1650701.
* Included account name in received header.
* Added stdout delivery.
* New append-string delivery to add data to a mail.

19 February 2007

* Added a remove-header action to remove all instances of a header. Based on a
  a request by Tobias Ulmer.

09 February 2007

* Reworked the substitution stuff. Each mail now carries a list of tag name,
  value pairs, some of which are autogenerated (account, action, etc) and others
  which may be added by the user. They may be inserted in strings using %[name].
  The autogenerated tags are aliased to the old single letter tokens. Based on
  a question from AJ Weber.
* Added a timeout option to limit the time for which servers are waited.

08 February 2007

* Added file-umask and file-group options to control permissions and group
  ownership of created mboxes and maildirs. Altered the permissions checks
  to take this into account, and extended them to maildirs. Suggestion from
  AJ Weber.
* Made mbox/maildir creation clearer in documentation.

07 February 2007

* Added -D command line option to define a macro.

05 February 2007

* Made options be printed with -v.

27 January 2007

* Fixed attachment parsing so that it works as intended.

26 January 2007

* Started a changelog.
* Assigned a number to each rule and changed logging to refer to it. Also
  tweaked the -vv configuration file output.
* Changed some vasprintf to xvasprintf now that the latter exists.
* Fixed command.c to trim CR line end if present, this makes IMAP over ssh
  work. (0.9a)
* Fixed miscalculation of length in find_header. (0.9a)
* Fixed find_header to locate the first rather than second instance.
* Added FQDN and what it resolves to to the domains list by default.
* Added a basic Received header with local host and fdm version, may be disabled
  with the new set no-received option.
* Free mmap'd region before mmap'ing it again in shm_realloc, otherwise the
  actual disk space isn't freed. This affected previous versions too but
  the mail was very rarely reallocated, now that the header is added it is.
* Changed all the descriptions to static buffers and audited use of snprintf.
