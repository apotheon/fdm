.Sh NAME
.Nm fdm.conf
.Nd "fdm configuration file"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the
.Xr fdm 1
configuration file.
It defines
.Em accounts
from which to fetch mail, a number of possible
.Em actions
to take, and
.Em rules
connecting a regexp with an action.
The file is parsed once from top to bottom, so action and account definitions must appear before they are referenced in a rule.
Rules are evaluated from first to last and (unless overridden by the
.Ic continue
keyword) evaluation stops at the first match.
.Pp
The file has the following format:
.Pp
Empty lines and lines beginning with the
.Sq #
character are ignored.
.Pp
Regexps and strings must be enclosed in double quotes.
Special characters in regexps and strings must be escaped.
Note that this may mean double-escaping in regexps.
.Pp
Possible commands are covered in the following sections.
.Sh OPTIONS
Options are configured using the
.Ic set
command.
It may be followed by the following options, one per command:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic maximum-size Ar size
This is used to set the maximum size of a mail.
Mails larger than this limit are dropped and, if applicable, not deleted from the server.
.Pp
The size may be specified as a plain number in bytes or with a suffix of
.Ql K
for kilobytes,
.Ql M
for megabytes or
.Ql G
for gigabytes.
The default is one gigabyte.
.It Ic delete-oversized
If this option is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
attempts to delete messages which exceed
.Ic maximum-size ,
and continue.
If it is not specified, oversize messages are a fatal error and cause
.Xr fdm 1
to abort.
.It Ic allow-multiple
If this option is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
does not attempt to create a lock file and allows multiple instances to run simultaneously.
.It Ic lock-file Ar path
This sets an alternative lock file. The default is
.Pa ~/.fdm.lock
for non-root users and
.Pa /var/db/fdm.lock
for root.
.It Ic default-user Ar user
This sets the default user to change to before delivering mail, if
.Xr fdm 1
is running as root and no alternative user is specified as part of the action or rule.
This option may be override with the
.Fl u
switch on the command line.
A default user must be given if running as root.
.It Ic lock-types Ar type Ar ...
This specifies the locks to be used for mbox locking.
Possible types are
.Em fcntl ,
.Em flock ,
and
.Em dotlock .
The
.Em flock
and
.Em fcntl
types are mutually exclusive.
The default is
.Em flock .
.It Xo Ic domain Ar domain | Ic domains
.Li {
.Ar domain Ar ...
.Li }
.Xc
This specifies the domains to be used when looking for users with the
.Ic from-headers
keyword.
The default is the computer's hostname.
.It Xo Ic header Ar header | Ic headers
.Li {
.Ar header Ar ...
.Li }
.Xc
This allows the headers to be examined when looking for users to be set.
The default is to look only at the "From" and "Cc" headers.
The headers are case-insensitive.
.It Ic proxy Ar url
This instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to proxy all connections through
.Ar url .
HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies are supported at present (URLs of the form
.Em http://host[:port] or
.Em socks://[user:pass@]host[:port]) .
No authentication is supported for HTTP.
This option may be overridden by an
.Em http_proxy
variable in the environment.
.El
.Sh INCLUDING FILES
Further configuration files may be including using the
.Ic include
command:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic include Ar path
.El
.Pp
The file to include is searched for first as an absolute path and then relative to the directory containing the main configuration file.
.Sh MACROS
Macros may be defined using the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar $name Ic = Ar string                                                  
.It Ar %name Ic = Ar number
.El
.Pp
Macros are prefixed with $ to indicate a string value and % to indicate a numeri\
c value.
Once defined, a macro may be used in any place a string or number is expected. M\
acros may be embedded in strings by surrounding their name (after the $ or %) wi\
th {}s, like so:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent                                                       
"abc ${mymacro} %{anothermacro} def"                                             
.Ed
.Sh ACCOUNTS
The
.Ic account
command is used to instruct
.Xr fdm 1
to fetch mail from an account.
The syntax is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic account Ar name Op Ic disabled
.Ar type Op Ar args
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar name
argument is a string specifying a name for the account.
The
.Ic disabled
keyword instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to ignore this account unless it is explicitly enabled with a
.Fl a
option on the command line.
Supported account types and arguments are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic stdin
This account type reads mail from
.Em stdin ,
if it is connected to a pipe.
This may be used to deliver mail from
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
see
.Xr fdm 1
for details.
.It Xo Ic pop3 Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Ic user Ar user Ic pass Ar pass
.Xc
.It Xo Ic pop3s Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Ic user Ar user Ic pass Ar pass
.Xc
These statements define a POP3 or POP3S account.
The
.Ar host ,
.Ar user
and
.Ar pass
arguments must be strings.
The port option may be either a string which will be looked up in the
.Xr services 5
database, or a number.
If it is omitted, the default port (143 for POP3, 993 for POP3S) is used.
.It Xo Ic imap Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Ic user Ar user Ic pass Ar pass
.Op Ic folder Ar name
.Xc
.It Xo Ic imaps Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Ic user Ar user Ic pass Ar pass
.Op Ic folder Ar name
.Xc
These define an IMAP or IMAPS account.
The parameters are as for a POP3 or POP3 account, aside from the additional
.Ic folder
option which allows the folder name to be specified (the default is to fetch from the inbox).
.El
.Sh ACTIONS
The
.Ic action
command is used to define actions.
These may be specified by name in rules (see below) to perform some action on a mail.
The syntax is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic action Ar name Op Ar users
.Ar action
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar name
is a string defining a name for the action.
The optional
.Ar users
argument has the following form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic user Ar user | Ic users
.Li {
.Ar user ...
.Li } |
.Ic user Ic from-headers
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The first two options specify a user or list of users as which the mail should be delivered.
If
.Ic user Ic from-headers
is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
attempts to find the users from the mail headers, using the values of the
.Ic headers
and
.Ic domains
options.
If no headers are specified, or
.Xr fdm 1
fails to find any valid users in the headers, the default user (set with
.Ic set Ic default-user )
is used.
An action's user setting may be overridden in the matching rule.
This keyword has no effect if
.Xr fdm 1
is run as non-root.
.Pp
The possible values for
.Ar action
are listed below.
In actions for which a
.Ar command
or
.Ar path
is specified, the following substitutions are made before it is used:
.Em %a
is replaced by the account name,
.Em %h
by the current user's home directory,
.Em %t
by the name of the current action,
.Em %u
by the current user's login name and
.Em %n
by the UID.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic drop
.Xc
Discard the mail.
.It Xo Ic maildir Ar path
.Xc
Save the mail to the maildir specified by
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic mbox Ar path
.Xc
Append the mail to the mbox at
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic pipe Ar command
.Xc
Pipe the entire mail to
.Ar command .
.It Xo Ic write Ar path
.Xc
Write the mail to
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic append Ar path
.Xc
Append the mail to
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic smtp Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ic to Ar to
.Xc
Connect to an SMTP server and attempt to deliver the mail to it.
If
.Ar to
is specified, it is passed to the server in the RCPT TO command.
If not, the current user and host names are used.
.It Xo Ic rewrite Ar command
.Xc
Pipe the entire mail through
.Ar command
to generate a new mail and use that mail for any following actions or rules.
An example of the
.Ic rewrite
action is:
.Bd -literal -ragged -offset indent
action "cat" pipe "cat"
action "rewrite" rewrite "sed 's/bob/fred/g'"
# this rule will rewrite the message and then cat it
match all actions { "rewrite" "cat" } continue
# this rule will cat the original message
match all action "cat"
.Ed
.El
.Sh RULES
Rules are specified using the
.Ic match
keyword.
It has one of the following basic forms:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic match
.Ar conditions
.Op Ar accounts
.Op Ar users
.Ar actions
.Op Ic continue
.Xc
.It Xo Ic match
.Ar conditions
.Op Ar accounts
.Ic tag Ar string
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar condition
argument may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic all
Matches all mail.
.It Ic matched
Matches only mail that has matched a previous rule and been passed on with
.Ic continue .
.It Ic unmatched
The opposite of
.Ic matched :
matches only mails which have matched no previous rules.
.It Xo Ic tagged Ar string
.Op Ic and | Ic or Ar ...
.Xc
Matches mails tagged with 
.Ar string .
.It Xo Op Ic not
.Op Ic case
.Ar regexp
.Op Ic in Ic headers | Ic in body
.Op Ic and | Ic or Ar ...
.Xc
Specifies a list of regexps against which each mail should be matched.
The regexp matches may be restricted to either the headers or body of the message by specifying either
.Ic in headers
or
.Ic in body .
If the
.Ic not
keyword is specified, the sense of the regexp match is inverted, so the rule will apply to mails only where the regexp does
.Em not
match.
The
.Ic case
keyword forces the regexp to be matched case-sensitively: the default is case-insensitive matching.
.El
.Pp
Aside from the
.Ic all ,
.Ic matched
and
.Ic unmatched 
conditions, multiple conditions may be chained together using the
.Ic and
or
.Ic or
keywords.
The conditions are tested from left to right.

The first form of the command specifies a number of actions to take when a mail matches the rule.
The second form tags the mail with 
.Ar string ,
which may be matched using the
.Ic tagged
condition in later rules. A mail may be tagged with any number of different strings by different rules.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar users
argument to the first form has the same syntax as for an
.Ic action
definition.
A rule's user list overrides any users given as part of the actions.
.Pp
Both the
.Ar accounts
and
.Ar actions
parts consist either of a single name or a list of names enclosed in braces:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic account Ar name | Ic accounts
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic action Ar name | Ic actions
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar accounts
list is used to limit rules to matching mail within a set of accounts, and the
.Ar actions
list specifies the actions to perform when the rule matches a mail.
The account names may include shell glob wildcards to match multiple accounts, as with
the
.Fl a
and
.Fl x
command line options.
The actions are performed from left to right in the order they are specified in the rule definition.
.Pp
If the
.Ic continue
keyword is present, evaluation will not stop if this rule is matched.
Instead,
.Xr fdm 1
will continue to match further rules after performing any actions for this rule.
